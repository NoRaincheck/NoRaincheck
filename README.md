### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning research in my spare time. I'm also looking at ways to improve machine learning inference in battle-tested production systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, Kotlin and Rust
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Simply @ me by raising an issue in [my personal repository](https://github.com/NoRaincheck/NoRaincheck)

<!-- **My research code:**

- [TreeGrad](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/TreeGrad): Differential Decision Trees based on my research paper
- [Diverse Online Feature Selection](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/diverse-online-feature-selection): Diverse Feature Selection using Determinantal Point Processes based on my research
- [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Toolkit](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/marl-offline-coordination): My PhD research code with various implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning including LICA, QCGraph, MARQ, QMIX, and more...
- [Online GentleBoost](https://github.com/chipmunk-pixel/online-gentleboost): The online variation of Gentleboost with some benchmarks

- [Scene Completion](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Scene-Completion): An implementation of "Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs"
- [Graph Differential Pooling](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/graph-differential-pooling): A short tutorial/implementation of graph differential pooling to understand how it works
- [Hoeffding Trees](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Hoeffding-Trees): A minimal implemention of Hoeffding trees with visualizations to understand how they work
- [Feature Rich Encodings](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/feature-rich-encoding): An implementation of feature rich encodings for NLP applications

**My foray into parsers and compilers:**

- [Ramble](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Ramble): A combinatory parser for the R programming language
- [Stan](https://github.com/8bit-pixies/Stan): A SAS transcompiler to Python for the SAS programming language
